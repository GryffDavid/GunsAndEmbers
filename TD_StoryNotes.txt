Literally just thoughts I have about the any sort of story I would want to add to the game. 

STORY: 
- Moral ambiguity

-Flavour text is a good way to provide little glimpses into the world. E.g. On the fire trap “We aren’t really sure when fire was invented but as far as galactic historians can tell it was some time before 1985”.

-C-Beams have been outlawed for a couple centuries already. It was decided that caesium based organ vaporisation was too inhumane to use. It’s a pity really - they were apparently very beautiful to look at.

-Earth has already colonized multiple planets outside our solar system. Those planets are now starting to rebel and the player is put in place to defend these planetary outposts.

-Could be that as the story progresses the people who hired the player OR the people/aliens that are assaulting the player decide that instead of letting anyone have the planets they’d rather destroy them completely, condemning the player AND all the invaders on the planets. 

-There should be a feeling of expanding story. That which hangs in the balance gets bigger and bigger. E.g. instead of just saving yourself you now have to save mankind and then the planet and then the solar system.

-Rebels are beginning to band together with the native species (“natives”).


“So Terra was invaded then?”
“What? It’s just called Earth, don’t be a douche. And no, it wasn’t”.
“So we ran out of resources?”
“Nope.”
“Pollution?”
“Fixed that in the 2060’s”
“We pretty much just wanted them”

Humans are a virus, as soon as they get an opportunity (FTL travel) they will spread consuming all that they can. We took over the planets because that’s what we do. 

“That’s really the flag we went with? It’s a bit imperious for a democracy don’t you think?”

Planet Name: Pandora XXVII (Many planets in Sci fi are named Pandora)

-Invaders could drop “Notes” that give a quick insight into the story. E.g Letting the player see something from the point of view of the invader they just killed. Maybe show it to the player as soon as it’s picked up, but it could be a lot better to show it at the end of the level so as not to interrupt gameplay. Rather let the player have the satisfaction of seeing the note at the end of the level. Additionally, if a player’s tower is destroyed and they have to restart the level, still show them the note that they found? Maybe get them to finish the level first but once it’s been found it should be seen by the player even if they lose that particular round of play. E.g. Found a note on level 5, then lost the level. Tried again, this time won, show the note that was found before. Do not require the player to find the note again.
